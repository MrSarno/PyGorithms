This repository primarily focuses on a number of algorithms implemented in Python 3, with a brief look at data structures early on. Rather than comprising one application, each of the subdirectories contains its own independent Python code. The code included is not executable; it is intended to be read as-is.

I created the files contained within while looking at the YouTube channel [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)'s video titled Algorithms in Python â€“ Full Course for Beginners, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW_OS3LGB9Q).

The course material was originally created by [RealToughCandy](https://realtoughcandy.io/).
